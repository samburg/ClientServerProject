This is my dummy text file
it has some text in it
hopefully it will get transmitted properly
I am just filling in whatever I can think of at this point so that hopefully the file has enough content that it is an
interesting challenge for the program to transmit. I think each char is 2 bytes so that's a lot of bytes at this point...
but the cap on a packet is 1400 bytes so i feel like maybe this can all fit in one packet?
I'm going to leave it here for now and we'll find out
